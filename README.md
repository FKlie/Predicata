## About
* J. Shallit has successfully used automata theory to find properties of automatic sequences. 
* In a summer school course at RISC, JKU Linz, he explained also how to use finite automata to decide Presburger arithmetic.
* This package, written as a Master thesis, implements the decision procedure which goes back to J. R. BÃ¼chi.
* Furthermore, it allows to construct a deterministic finite automaton from any first-order formula with the addition as the only operation.
* The package Automata is used for the data structure of finite automata.
* For further insight feel free to ask me for my Master thesis.

## Install
* Download and unpack the archive into the GAP "pkg" subdirectory. 
* Alternatively, most likely ~home/.gap/pkg (Windows: _gap/pkg) is also a possible directory (Use WriteGapIniFile(); to get the right directory).
* Call the package with LoadPackage("Predicata");
